This is a standalone version of the Rails migrations. For the migration system to work you need Ruby, Gems, and ActiveRecord installed.

INSTALLATION
------------
Most Linux systems have pre-existing packages for Ruby and Ruby gems.
Once Ruby and Gem is installed, as root run:
gem install -y activerecord mysql

cd config
cp database_sample.yml database.yml
edit database.yml (and change settings for your database)

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
A good source to learn how to use migrations is:
http://dizzy.co.uk/ruby_on_rails/cheatsheets/rails-migrations
or if you're lazy you can just use the execute method to execute raw SQL

def self.up
  execute "insert into foo values (123,'something');"
end

def self.down
  execute "delete from foo where field='something';"
end


USAGE
-----
To create a new database migration run:

./new_migration us_131_some_project

This will create migrations/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_us_131_some_project.rb

edit migrations/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_us_131_some_project.rb

and fill in the up and down migrations. To apply your newest migration

./migrate 

To migrate to a specific version (for example to rollback)

./migrate VERSION=20081220234130
